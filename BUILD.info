RogueMek Build Instructions for Linux, Windows, and OSX
https://github.com/harbdog/roguemek

-----------------------------------------------

Required Software:
Oracle JDK 1.7 (oracle.com)
Grails 2.4.2

Optional Software:
Tomcat 7
Git

-----------------------------------------------

1. Make sure the pre-requisite software is properly installed
1a. Oracle JDK 1.7 - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
1b. Grails 2.4.2 - http://dist.springframework.org.s3.amazonaws.com/release/GRAILS/grails-2.4.2.zip

2. Download project source using git or as a ZIP from GitHub.

3. Modify RogueMek-config.groovy to change default passwords and other important things (such as external database settings),
   or copy to another location and reference it with an environment variable named ROGUEMEK_CONFIG. For example:
        set ROGUEMEK_CONFIG=C:\MyRogueMek-config.groovy

3a. By default an H2 database is used, which is a local memory or file based database which requires no additional installation on your part to use.

4. From a command line, enter the following commands to try running in development mode. 
   NOTE: Development mode always deletes stored data between runs, so only use it for development or testing purposes.
   
4a. Change directory to where the RogueMek code was downloaded or extracted. For example:
        cd C:\roguemek
	
4b. Execute the grails command from the location where Grails was extracted to run. For example:
        C:\grails-2.4.2\bin\grails run-app

5. If there are no further errors after it is finished starting up, point your browser to http://localhost:8080/RogueMek

6. When you are ready to deploy for production usage, either run using "grails prod run-app",
   or ideally generate a war file using "grails prod war" and deploy it to a Tomcat server.

NOTES:
- The first error you will most likely see is that you need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. 
  Make sure it is set to the correct location of your JDK installation. For example:
      set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79
   
- Another possible error is If you already have a JAVA_HOME set to a newer or older version of the JDK that will not work.

- Some warnings always appear in the log related to AtmosphereFramework, these are usually normal.

- When running as a war in Tomcat, you will likely need to increase its JVM max memory pool (-Xmx392m), and increase PermGen space (-XX:MaxPermSize=128m)
