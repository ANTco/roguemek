RogueMek Deployment Instructions for Linux, Windows, and OSX
https://github.com/harbdog/roguemek

-----------------------------------------------

Required Software:
Tomcat 7

-----------------------------------------------

1. Make sure the pre-requisite software is properly installed
   Tomcat 7 - https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
   
2. Download release war file "RogueMek.war", or build one yourself following the instructions in the BUILD.info file.

3. Additional Tomcat JVM settings will be required before starting the Tomcat server:
   + increase JVM max memory pool (-Xmx392m)
   + increase PermGen space (-XX:MaxPermSize=128m)

4. If not already customized in your own built war file, copy and modify RogueMek-config.groovy to change default passwords 
   and other important things (such as external database settings), and reference its location path with an environment variable 
   named ROGUEMEK_CONFIG. For example:
        set ROGUEMEK_CONFIG=C:\MyRogueMek-config.groovy
        
5. Start the Tomcat server and wait for it to finish. If there are no further errors after it is finished starting up, 
   point your browser to http://localhost:8080/RogueMek (assuming you kept the default port settings).
